### First Impressions on Javascript
At first, Javascript was very familiar and felt similar to C/C++. Then, throughout the module (specifically the FreeCodeCamp part), it got very interesting, especially regarding array manipulation. This was my first time with Javascript, but since I have experience in Bash scripting, there are similarities between the two that helped me out, such as the variable declarations. After some time however, I was getting used to some of the differences between Javascript and other languages that I know and I felt like I could definitely use Javascript if I needed to use it for something else, like a work project.

I think that Javascript is a decent programming language for software engineering, perhaps the best scripting language (Perl and Bash can get pretty confusing). Considering how widely used Javascript is, there must be some reason for that and it's probably because it's pretty easy to pick up and learn the basics within hours.

### Thoughts on WODs
As for athletic software engineering, I think it's very important. Doing WOD's (workouts-of-the-day) helps novice and senior programmers alike by keeping their wits sharp and giving them refreshers if they stay away from coding anything for a while. Personally, the WODs were a nice test to see what my skills were like based on the scales given for each WOD (Rx, Avg, Sd) and were very useful overall. I think it is a practice that should be used more often and regularly to keep programmers on their toes, even though it can be stressful. Since project Euler has more than just two problems, I will try to attempt more of their problems as personal WODs in the future.

You always hear about big companies like Google and Amazon giving timed tests just like these to programmers during their interviewing process. If this is true, then introducing students to WODs early in their careers as programmers is very important for their future preparations. Overall, I enjoyed the WOD portion for Javascript in this class and am curious to see future WODs.
