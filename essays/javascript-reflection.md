After some time however, I was getting used to some of the differences between Javascript and other languages that I know and I felt like I could definitely use Javascript if I needed to use it for something else, like a work project.

Considering how widely used Javascript is, there must be some reason for that and it's probably because it's pretty easy to pick up and learn the basics within hours.

As for athletic software engineering, I think it's very important. Doing WOD's (workouts-of-the-day) helps novice and senior programmers alike by keeping their wits sharp and giving them
