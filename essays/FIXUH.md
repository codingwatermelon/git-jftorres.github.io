The problem: UH has many problems with broken stuff, especially restrooms. There have been too many times where I've entered a restroom with a broken door handle, missing soap, and rancid odors. In addition to restroom issues, there are other facility problems throughout UH.

The solution: Our application aims to try to end that by providing a platform for students and faculty to submit repair tickets for certain areas. Repair tickets include description of the problem, location, and image of the issue. Repair tickets may be "upvoted" for awareness by other users, so that the ticket gains attention from administrators.

The approach:
    Landing page
    Listing of all current tickets with navigation/filter bar, with login/sign up on the top right, contact information on the bottom
    User home page
    Same as landing page, but with options to create a ticket, view your current tickets, follow a ticket, view followed tickets, upvote tickets
    Admin home page
    Same as user home page, but with options to view all users, edit tickets, delete tickets, and block users

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

    Create a geolocation-type map of all of the tickets mapped out physically
