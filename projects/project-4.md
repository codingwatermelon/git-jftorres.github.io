summary: My ICS 314 Final group project named Manoa311.
---

I, along with three other members (Nolan P, Michael K, and Jason M) developed a web application called Manoa311 in Meteor. 

The goal of the application was to provide UH students, faculty, and administration with a tool to report and remediate issues around campus. More information is available on the official website for the application, https://manoa311.github.io/. For a link to the actual application, click here: http://manoa311.meteorapp.com/#/.

Here's what the landing page looks like:
