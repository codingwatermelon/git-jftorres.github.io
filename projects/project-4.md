summary: My ICS 314 Final group project named Manoa311.
---

I, along with three other members (Nolan P, Michael K, and Jason M) developed a web application called Manoa311 in Meteor. 

The goal of the application was to provide UH students, faculty, and administration with a tool to report and remediate issues around campus. 
More information is available on the official website for the application, [manoa311 - Information](https://manoa311.github.io/). 
For a link to the actual application, click here: [manoa311 - Meteor App](http://manoa311.meteorapp.com/#/).
