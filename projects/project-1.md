Below is an example of the Icinga2 web interface, something that I work with quite often (not my environment):
<div class="ui large rounded images">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/icinga2pic1.jpg">
</div>

I've also integrated the web interface with a smaller, more concise dashboard interface using a software called Dashing (also not my environment):
<div class="ui large rounded images">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/icinga2pic2.png">
</div>

Overall, I'd say working with Icinga2 has made me appreciate network monitoring and system administrator tasks, something that I would consider doing for a career.
